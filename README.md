Advanced-React E-Commerce Application

Overview of the Project
This e-commerce web application is based on React and was created using **Vite**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **React Query**.

This project is an online shopping application created using React technology.

Vite is a tool designed to help developers build applications quickly during the development process. Redux Toolkit is used to handle the overall state of the shopping cart.

React Query is a tool used to retrieve and store data from APIs. The FakeStore API serves as a simulated backend that includes various products and categories.

CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the appearance and arrangement of web pages. The application allows users to: Explore items available through the FakeStore API. "Sort products based on their category." "Include or take out items from the shopping cart." "Check the number of items in your cart and the overall total amount." Address the absence of product images by implementing a backup solution. "Enjoy real-time updates using Redux and React Query."

**Features** The product catalog retrieves and shows a list of products, including their images, prices, categories, descriptions, and ratings.

Dynamic category navigation is a dropdown menu that helps users filter products effectively.

Cart Management involves the actions of adding items, removing items, clearing the entire cart, and updating the quantity of specific items.
